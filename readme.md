Notes:

- Portfolio stuff goes in `data`
- The conversion of portfolio stuff from csv to json happens in `data/convert.js`
- Image size for portfolio is 350px by 150px. Or 7:3 
- The site publishes from the `/docs` folder: more info: https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/

Scripts:
- To develop, run `npm start`
   - All the source files are in `src` and compile to root because of how github pages works
- To deploy, run `npm run deploy` and push changes
