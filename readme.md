# Scott Pham's Portfolio Site 
This is a simple, responsive portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and Alpine.js. It dynamically loads portfolio data from a CSV file, making it easy to update and maintain. 

## Setup 
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. 2. Ensure you have the following files in place: - `index.html` (main HTML file) - `portfolio.csv` (your portfolio data) - `assets/images/brooklyn.png` (your headshot) - `assets/scottpham_resume.pdf` (your resume) - Image files for each portfolio item in the `assets/images/` directory (350px by 150px, or 7:3 aspect ratio)

## Usage To view the site locally: 
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser. Note: Some browsers may block loading local CSV files for security reasons. In this case, you'll need to use a local server. You can use Python's built-in HTTP server:
